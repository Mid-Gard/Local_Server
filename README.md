# Local_Server

This porject inclues the codes and system configurations for setting up WebApp (Development will be happening in this repo itself), Database installation and hosting and for ML model deployment. For this we are using the PC from AC lab. The idea is to use a local PC for testing and setup and after sucessful deployment. The same can be replicated onto cloud servers or in docker environment as suitable.


### Few points to note
1. If you want to do any changes, clone the repo, create your own branch and then start the development. Nothing will be pushed directly in the main branch. Whoever will bring new feature in the Web App or the server backend, will need to explain it first to all members and the will merge it.
2. New branch is coming up with NextJS. The development will go parallely with the main branch which is under ReactJS.
3. Do not install anything on the PC over the table, if any depency issue happens will need to do everything from scratch, as all the database, webapp and ML model will be deployed on it. Do not use it for testing any other work. Only log in to the GEC ETC standard user. Do not login into the uroot or Root User.



## ToDo
1. Need to create fresh NextJs branch and setup
2. Use playit.gg to host the webapp on internet
3. Create wireframe on Excalidraw
4. Create desing on Figma
